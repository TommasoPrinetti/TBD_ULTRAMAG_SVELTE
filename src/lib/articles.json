This interest related to a new critical paradigm is directly connected with the wider cultural phenomenon of the crisis of traditional humanism, named posthumanism It may be said that the animal turn is a direct consequence of this ontological crisis to which an interest in non-human species is connected.

After all, animal studies have influenced and transformed post-humanist thought, enriching it with issues concerning human limits and cultural construction, reorienting in turn the issue of the ‘affects’ (Gregg and Seigworth, 2010) and of the body, giving them higher ethical and political momentum (Nayar, 2014: 79).",

            "Le ultime spiagge di unicità o sono state inquinate o le hanno trasformate in parco giochi: il linguaggio, l’uso di strumenti, il comportamento sociale, gli eventi mentali non stabiliscono più in modo convincente la separazione tra umano e animale. E parecchi non sentono più il bisogno di questa separazione […]. Il cyborg entra nel mito proprio quando si trasgredisce il confine tra umano e animale. Lungi dal segnalare una drastica separazione delle persone dalle altre creature viventi, il cyborg indica, in modo inquietante e piacevole, un saldo accoppiamento. In questo ciclo di scambio matrimoniale, la bestialità ha un nuovo status” (Haraway 1995)",

            "p2": "Kari Weil (2010: 12), who has conducted important research on the topic of the relationship between humans and animals, states that the animal turn contributed to a ‘counter-linguistic shift’ against the structuralist dimension typical of the early 20th century. This shift encouraged an attempt at going beyond the confining, exclusive focus on language and at opening up to different approaches to reality, alterity and humanity itself (Weil, 2010: 4). Language, indeed, has always been a distinctive human sign and the alleged lack of it marked the inferiority and exclusion of the Other and of the non-human. Therefore, post-humanist decentralisation also involves a decentralisation of language and of its exclusivity. Weil (2010: 13) also suggests that counter-linguistic commitment is in itself an ethical act as it pays attention to the ineffable, which turns to the body and its ‘affects’. This entails a heavy ethical charge that leads animal studies towards new ways to answer  and new forms of responsibility. Doubtlessly  each of the different currents of the post-humanist universe entails an ethical and political project of its own; however, the animal turn has favoured the development of further emphasis on ethics, giving new meanings to concepts such as subjectivity, alterity andagency. Having reached this point, the trajectory of Haraway from cyborg to ‘companion species’ may again be considered as an indicator of a renewed interest on interspecies ethics. Human decentralisation matches a questioning of humanist ethics, of who or what matters as a subject and which duties and responsibilities there are towards others. The animal turn contributed to this domain by widening the category of subjectivity, and from the very beginning animal ethics has questioned the exclusivity of human subjectivity. Focusing on non-human animals breached humanist limits of alterity and ethical consideration. Weil states (2010: 17) that authentic post-human ethics should deal with ‘an unknowable or “incalculable” other’, hence it should relate to non-human animals; this is because, as added by Derrida (2006: 90), animals represent the absolute alterity. This rearrangement of the fundamental ethical categories needs a qualitative change of the terms and ways of the ethical debate. Ultimately, supporting the vital bond between human beings and other species is not only necessary, but also useful, despite the fact that anthropomorphising animals in order to bestow principles of moral and legal equality on them too  confirms the binary distinction between human and animal and fully denies animal specificity. Therefore, it is possible to state that post-humanist ethics have to go beyond the limits of traditional ethics and open up not only to new forms of subjectivity and alterity, but also to new ways and modes of relation and action. This shows that overcoming humanism requires full, constant attention and a continuous re-examination of terms to avoid settling for easy results.",
